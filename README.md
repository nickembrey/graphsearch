## Description

_The program prompts user for an input file that describes a graph. The graph file is described by the following parameters:

* The first line contains the graph name. (<= 20 characters)
* The second line contains the number of vertices on the graph. (2 <= vertices <= 20)
* The third line contains the number of edges in the graph. (edges <= vertices)
* The following lines contain ordered pairs that describe the edges in the form (v1,v2).
* The final line contains the start vertex for the searches.

The program uses the graph described in this file to run a demo breadth-first and depth-first search. These searches traverse the entire graph and print the vertices they visit in order without repeating vertices that are visited more than once._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Download source code to an empty directory._
* _Run 'make' from the command line._
* _Run sdriver and input the name of a file describing a graph (see above for format)._
